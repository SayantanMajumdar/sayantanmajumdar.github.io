Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) traces provide a discrete representation of 
an individual's interstitial fluid glucose concentration (ISF). The continuous 
blood glucose concentration (BG) however, is a more useful and desired physical 
quantity to be measured. Traditionally, BG was the primary metric for diagnosing 
*Diabetes Mellitus* (DM). There are however, no clear and reliable method for 
constructing the continuous BG from the measured discrete ISF. It is still an 
active area of research. We developed a method based on trajectory optimization 
where we assume a simple differential equation describing the BG-ISF dynamics 
and estimate the continuous BG that would generate discrete ISF measurements as 
close as possible to the CGM trace.
