*Diabetes Mellitus* (DM) is a metabolic disorder which affects a large 
percentage of the worlds population. Diagnosing DM is usually done using various 
metrics like HbA1c, fasting blood glucose concnetration (FBG), post-parandial 
blood glucose concnetration (PPBG), average blood glucose concentration (aBG), 
etc. A majority of these metrics are either derived from the blood glucose 
concentration (BG) or are proxies for the BG in some way. The recently developed 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices generally measure the interstitial 
fluid glucose concentration (ISF) and provide a finite sequence of the 
measurements. It would be useful if the ISF-BG dynamics could be exploited to 
obtain an estimate of the continuous BG from the CGM trace. We have developed a 
method based on trajectory optimization that provides an estimate of the 
continuous BG from the discrete ISF measurements provided by the CGM devices.
