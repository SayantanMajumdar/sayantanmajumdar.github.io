The continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) traces from any individual can be 
considered a sequence of snapshots of their interstitial fluid 
glucose concentration (ISF). These snapshots can be considered to be a 
representation of that individual's ISF dynamics. This is a relatively new tool 
and there has been various attempts to use CGM traces to understand the 
glucose-insulin dynamics of the human body for example, estimating 
various metrics used to diagnose *Diabetes Mellitus* (DM) such as HbA1c, 
fasting blood glucose (FBG), etc. In this manuscript we have developed two 
methods for estimating HbA1c of an individual from the Indian population. We showed 
that the HbA1c estimated from the CGM traces, using these two methods, were 
statistically indistinguishable from the measured HbA1c.

Estimating HbA1c from an individual's CGM trace is still an open problem, various 
methods have been developed over the years. One such popular method was published in 
Nathan et al., 2008 [^1]. In this manuscript, we developed two similar methods. 
First, the direct method and the second the adapted Nathan model that provides 
statistically reliable HbA1c estimates using CGM traces from individuals of the 
Indian population.
