The software packages that I had developed over the years during my Ph.D. 
research has been listed bellow.

# CGM Analyzer  
**Versions Released:** 0.2 and 2.0  
**URL:** [https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/fgm-tools](https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/fgm-tools)  
*Note: The webapp is hosted on a development server. It may be offline for various technical reasons.
If you want to access the webapp but the server is offline, feel free to contact me.*  
**Programming Language:** **MATLAB**  

The CGM Analyzer is a web application, written in MATLAB, which analyzes  
CGM traces. The current version of the webapp can process CGM traces generated 
from the Abbott FreeStyle Libre Pro sensor. The webapp can be used to process 
a single or multiple CGM traces collectively in a batch mode and generate 
the metrics listed by Danne et al., 2017[^1]. It also provides estimates of HbA1c, 
calculated from the CGM traces, using two new methods from Majumdar et al., 2024[^2].
Version 2.0 also provides a method of estimating the continuous blood glucose 
concentration from a given CGM trace using a method from Majumdar 2024[^3].
