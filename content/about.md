I am Sayantan Majumdar, a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Biology, 
Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune. My research 
involves solving problems at the intersection of *Optimization 
Theory*, *Inverse Theory*, *Dynamical Systems Theory*, *Control Theory*, 
*Dynamic Input Recovery*, and *Trajectory Optimization*. The current research for 
my Ph.D. thesis involved the analysis of continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) traces obtained from diabetes patients. It involved developing 
a method for estimating the HbA1c of the patient from their CGM trace. 
It also involved obtaining an estimate of the
continuous glucose concentration in the plasma (BG) of the patient. 
I have successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis this 
December, 2024. I plan on continuing my research on these problems, developing 
mathematical tools and algorithms to solve such problems numerically.
